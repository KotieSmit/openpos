ft - Added 2 costing methods:  Last cost and Ave cost
        Last cost: Updates the item's cost price with the last purchase cost of an item.
        Ave cost: Takes current value of items in stock, adds total value of items bought, and calculates a new average cost
                eg. 10 in stock @ 2.00 each.  Stock value = 20.00.
                   Buy new stock in 5 @ 3.00 = 15.00
                   New total value = 35
                   New cost = 35 / 15 = 2.333...
